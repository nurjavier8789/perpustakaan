## Wait where's the file?
go to [src/perpus](https://github.com/nurjavier8789/perpustakaan/tree/main/src/perpus), you'll find `.java` file

## How to run?
just download all this file or clone it to your local dekstop and open it with your **netbeans** and run [`run.java`](https://github.com/nurjavier8789/perpustakaan/blob/main/src/perpus/run.java) file

or maybe you can just clone/download `.java` file and run it on **VS Code** using java extension
